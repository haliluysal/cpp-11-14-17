/*


* every object is instantiated
* every object is an instance of a class
* class can have multiple instances


* Default Constructor
* Parameterized Constructor
* Destructor - one desctructor and cannot be overloaded


* you can initialize in class description. called non static member initialization

* this pointer:
*	- hidden functionality to access class members (method/variable)
*	- 


* Const Member functions:
*		- member functions qualified with const keyword
*		- both declaration and definition is qualified
*		- cannot change value of any member variables - READ ONLY functions
* 


* static member variables
*		- initialized outside of the class
*		- static across the object instances
*		- shared among the class instances


* static member function
*		- belong to class not object
*		- invoked outside of the class. 
*		- this will enable you to call a function without creating an object
*		- 


* copy constructor
*		- creates copy of the obj state
*		- synthesized automatically - shallow copy
*		- we need to create a deep copy constructor!!
